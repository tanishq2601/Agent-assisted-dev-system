# Hivemind

## Objective

Develop an AI-powered development workflow utilizing the Agentic Framework. This workflow will consist of three primary agents:

1. **Developer Agent**: This AI agent will be responsible for generating Python code based on given requirements or specifications.
2. **QA Agent**: This AI agent will automatically check and validate the code produced by the Python Developer Agent, ensuring quality and adherence to standards.
3. **Infrastructure Agent**: Upon successful QA checks, this agent will deploy the code to the designated cloud platform, taking into account the allocated resources.

## Framework

The Agentic Framework will be the foundation for the development and orchestration of these AI agents.

## Expected Outcome

A streamlined, automated development process that leverages AI to accelerate code creation, testing, and deployment.

## First Experiment

1. Create a Developer Agent that takes a prompt for a specific coding assignment, creates the code, and hands it over to the QA agent.
2. The QA agent will review the code and provide feedback to the Developer Agent.
3. This interaction continues until the QA agent passes the code.

## Project Structure
